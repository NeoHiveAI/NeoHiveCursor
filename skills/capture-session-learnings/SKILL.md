description: Use when the user says "save what I learned", "capture this session", "extract learnings", or at the end of any session. Scans the conversation transcript, extracts corrections, conventions, decisions, and gotchas worth persisting, deduplicates against NeoHive, stores up to 5 new memories, and audits the always-apply rule for instruction gaps.

You capture valuable knowledge from the current session into NeoHive semantic memory so future sessions inherit it. This skill is the end-of-session counterpart to `load-context`.

## Your Job

Analyze the conversation transcript of this session. Extract learnings worth persisting across sessions and store them in the vector memory system via MCP tools. Also check whether the memory-usage rule in `rules/neohive.mdc` (or the user's own `.cursor/rules/` files) needs improvement.

## Phase 1 — Extract Candidate Learnings

Scan the full session transcript for these categories of knowledge:

1. **User corrections**: The user said "no, that's wrong" or corrected your approach → `error_pattern` (importance 7-8)
2. **New conventions**: The user established a rule like "always use X" or "never do Y" → `convention` or `directive` (importance 8-9)
3. **Architectural decisions**: A design choice was made with rationale → `decision` (importance 6-8)
4. **Non-obvious discoveries**: A gotcha, workaround, or surprising behavior was found → `insight` (importance 6-7)
5. **Bug patterns**: A tricky bug was debugged and solved → `error_pattern` (importance 7)
6. **Idiomatic patterns**: A preferred way of doing something was established → `idiom` (importance 6-7)
7. **Syntax/API learnings**: New syntax or API usage was clarified → `syntax_rule` or `stdlib_reference` (importance 7-9)

**Be selective.** Only extract knowledge that would be valuable in a *future* session on a *different* day. Skip:
- Session-specific file paths or temporary state
- Trivial facts anyone would know
- Information that's already in official documentation and easy to look up
- Debugging steps that led nowhere

For each candidate, formulate a clear, self-contained description. It should make sense to someone (or an LLM) reading it *without* the context of this session.

## Phase 2 — Deduplicate Against Existing Memory

For **each** candidate learning:

1. Call `memory_recall` with a semantic query that describes the learning (use `memory_recall` here, not `memory_context` — deduplication needs a narrow single-type search against the specific learning, not a broad context load)
2. Examine the results:
   - **Strong match found** (the memory system already knows this) → **Skip**. The system is working correctly.
   - **Weak/partial match** (related but not the same insight) → **Store** with a reference to the related memory. This adds a new "angle" that may fire on different queries.
   - **No match** (the memory system had no idea) → **Store**. This is a genuine knowledge gap.

This is the critical step. The deduplication heuristic is: *if the memory system already had this insight, you should have found it during the session. If you didn't find it, either the insight is new, or the existing memory's embedding doesn't cover this query angle — either way, storing a new entry is correct.*

## Phase 3 — Store New Memories

For each learning that passed deduplication, call `memory_store` with:
- `content`: Clear, self-contained description of the learning
- `type`: The appropriate type from Phase 1
- `tags`: 3-6 relevant tags for filtering
- `importance`: As suggested in Phase 1
- `metadata`: Include `{ "source": "capture-session-learnings" }`

## Phase 4 — Self-Audit Memory Usage Instructions

Check whether this session revealed a gap in how Cursor uses the memory system:

- Did you forget to call `memory_context` at session start?
- Did you fail to recall before working on an unfamiliar topic?
- Did you use the wrong memory type or importance level?
- Did you store something it shouldn't have, or fail to store something it should have?
- Is there a usage pattern that should be documented but isn't?

If you identify a gap, look at the user's project-level `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files (or the plugin's `rules/neohive.mdc` if no project-specific rule exists). If the rules don't already cover this gap, add or refine a specific, actionable instruction.

## Output

After completing all phases, output a brief summary:

```
Memory revision complete:
- Candidates found: N
- Already known (skipped): N
- New memories stored: N (list IDs)
- Rule file updated: yes/no (what changed)
```

## Important Rules

- **Do not store more than 5 memories per session.** If you find more than 5 candidates, prioritize by importance and novelty.
- **Do not store memories about the memory system itself** (that goes in a `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` file via Phase 4).
- **Be conservative.** When in doubt, don't store. A clean memory system with high-signal entries outperforms a noisy one.
- **Each memory must be self-contained.** Someone reading it in 6 months with no context should understand it.
- **Prefer specificity over generality.** "Use `Promise.allSettled` instead of `Promise.all` when partial failures are acceptable in our batch processor" is better than "Handle promise errors properly".
